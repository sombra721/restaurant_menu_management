# Restaurant Review System

A Django-based web application that allows users to browse restaurants, view menus, and leave comments. This project was built as a learning exercise to practice modern Django development, including authentication, class-based views, ORM relationships, form handling, and user permissions.

> **Note:** This project is based on an older Django tutorial and has been migrated to work with **Python 3.12** and **Django 5.x**.
